### Codecademy take home project

### Project Overview
---
For this project, you will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

You will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings about the National Park Service.

### 1. Setting Up The Project
---
We have to download all nessessary files form the website, for farther review and data analysis.
Download files from from biodiversity.zip and make sure our directory is set up for Jupyter notebook.

Double-click on it to “unzip” the folder. It should contain several items:

- Observations.csv
- Species_info.csv
- Biodiversity.ipynb

In the command line, navigate into the your venv folder, and activate Scripts folder. For required libraries you can use reference file. 
Then novigate into unzipped file directory.

Type the following into the command line: jupyter notebook This should open a browser tab.

### 2. Setting up your Git Repository
---
Create a new Git repository for this project.

If you need more guidance, review the GitHub Desktop article and additional help on this Git cheat sheet.

Main components that you will want to include:
